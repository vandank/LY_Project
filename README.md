IoT Based Health Monitoring System for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)

In this project, we created a IoT based health monitoring system as a preliminary test for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) which can measure, observe and examine the patterns of sleep using parameters like movement of the body while sleeping, heart rate, oxygen saturation level (SpO2), and snoring sound levels with effective analytics to help evaluate the sleeping patterns of patients.
